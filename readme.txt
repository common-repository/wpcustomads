WPCustomAds enables you to inject customized ads into pre-defined areas of your template, using DOM-identifiers and classes.

== Description ==

<p>
WPCustomAds enables you to inject customized ads into pre-defined areas of your template. Similar plugins are way too hard to grasp as the end-user, which is something this plugin should be better at doing.
</p>

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin directory (wpcustomads-by-ninetwozero) to your wp-content/plugins folder
2. Activate the plugin
3. Make sure you have elements you want to fill with advertisement in your templates

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= But what about AdSense and those services? =

I believe that they're already been covered in a good way and that the plugins available out there are more than sufficient for them.
